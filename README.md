## Introduction

These are four project I have done with Machine-Learning method. Basically, I have tested Decision-Tree Model and different types of Neural Network on different task.

### Athene

> A Data-Mining competition, hosting by China Agriculture Bank. 

- Objection: Based on the given `DataSet` to predict each person' s probability of in debt.
- result: Ranking 40th out of 300+ teams.

### Wheels

> Small Project for my Data-Mining course. 
>
> I have mainly realized two models.

- Random-Forest-Classifier
  - `BootStrap ` Sampling
  - boosting method
  - picking training factors randomly
- Support-Vector-Classifier
  - with `rbf` core function
  - `SMO` algorithm

### `GRED`

> A project I am doing in my laboratory mainly for detecting adversarial examples and recovering the true labels. 

- with `OOP` method 
- `SaliencyBase` is the parent class, but usually perform as an interface.
- Other Two are child class detector and I keep doing this for making more detectors.

### `KANNADA`

> A classical problems on  `Kaggle` Competition platform.

I have tested different models' performance on this dataset.
